# Decentralized Energy Trading Platform

A blockchain-based platform enabling peer-to-peer renewable energy trading, grid management, IoT integration, and carbon credit tracking.

## Overview

The Decentralized Energy Trading Platform consists of four primary smart contracts that create an efficient energy marketplace:

1. Energy Token Contract
2. Grid Management Contract
3. Smart Meter Contract
4. Carbon Credit Contract

## Core Features

### Energy Token Contract
- Implements ERC-20 standard for energy unit representation
- Manages energy token minting based on generation
- Handles token burning upon energy consumption
- Supports batch transfers for efficient trading
- Implements time-based token expiration
- Tracks energy source and type
- Manages regulatory compliance

### Grid Management Contract
- Coordinates energy distribution across the network
- Implements real-time load balancing
- Manages grid capacity constraints
- Handles emergency protocols
- Implements peak load management
- Coordinates with smart meters
- Tracks grid performance metrics

### Smart Meter Contract
- Interfaces with IoT devices
- Validates energy generation and consumption
- Manages device registration and verification
- Handles automated meter readings
- Implements tamper detection
- Manages device maintenance status
- Supports firmware update tracking

### Carbon Credit Contract
- Manages carbon offset verification
- Handles credit issuance and retirement
- Implements credit trading functionality
- Tracks emission reduction metrics
- Manages credit expiration
- Handles regulatory reporting
- Supports credit bundling

    function burnEnergy(uint256 amount) external;
    function transferEnergy(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function getEnergySource(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (SourceData memory);
}
```

### Grid Management Contract
```solidity
interface IGridManagement {
    function registerNode(address node, NodeType nodeType) external;
    function updateLoadBalance(uint256 nodeId, uint256 load) external;
    function requestEnergyTransfer(uint256 fromNode, uint256 toNode, uint256 amount) external;
    function getGridStatus(uint256 nodeId) external view returns (GridStatus memory);
}
```

### Smart Meter Contract
```solidity
interface ISmartMeter {
    function registerDevice(address device, bytes memory deviceData) external;
    function submitReading(uint256 deviceId, uint256 reading) external;
    function validateReading(uint256 deviceId, uint256 readingId) external returns (bool);
    function getDeviceHistory(uint256 deviceId) external view returns (Reading[] memory);
}
```

### Carbon Credit Contract
```solidity
interface ICarbonCredit {
    function issueCreditsCertificate(address to, uint256 amount, bytes memory verificationData) external;
    function retireCredits(uint256 amount) external;
    function transferCredits(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function getEmissionReductions(uint256 certificateId) external view returns (EmissionData memory);
}
```
